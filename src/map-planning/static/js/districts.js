/**
 * Districts Module (Compatibility Layer)
 * Maintains backward compatibility while functionality is now in:
 * - data/districts-data.js (Data Layer)
 * - presentation/views/district-view.js (UI Layer)
 */

// Note: This file now serves as a thin compatibility layer
// All functionality has been moved to specialized modules:
// - Data operations: data/districts-data.js
// - UI rendering: presentation/views/district-view.js

// The districts array and functions are now exported from their respective modules
// This ensures all existing code continues to work without modification
